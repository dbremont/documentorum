# Vue

> Vue.js is a progressive, MVVM-based JavaScript framework that uses a declarative, reactive data-binding system, component-based architecture, and a virtual DOM for efficiently building user interfaces and managing application state.
> 

> **Vue.js architecture** is based on a **reactive data binding** system and a component-based structure, enabling the creation of dynamic user interfaces through a view layer supported by optional libraries and tools for state management and routing.
> 

> Virtual DOM: …
> 

> **Web Component**: Reusable and self-contained blocks of code encapsulating templates, logic, and styles.
> 

> **Reactive Data Binding**: The core feature that automatically synchronizes the UI with the underlying data model using a reactive system.
> 

> **Directives**: Special attributes in templates for DOM manipulation.
> 

> **Template Syntax**: Declarative syntax to bind data to the DOM using curly braces `({{ }})` and directives.
> 

> Vue Instance: The root object that manages the lifecycle of a Vue app, created using `new Vue()` or `createApp()` in Vue 3.
> 

> Props: Pass data from parent to child components.
> 

> Events: Emit events from child to parent components.
> 

> Lifecycle Hooks: Methods like created(), mounted(), updated(), and destroyed() allow you to perform actions at different stages of a component's lifecycle.
> 

> Computed Properties: Derived state that updates reactively based on dependencies, reducing boilerplate code.
> 

> Watchers: Observe changes to data properties and perform actions in response.
> 

> Slots: Enable content distribution in components to make them more reusable and customizable.
> 

> Routing (Vue Router): Manage navigation and map URLs to components in single-page applications.
> 

> State Management (Vuex or Pinia): Centralized state management tools for managing and sharing application state across components.
> 

> Reactive APIs (Vue 3): Tools like ref(), reactive(), and computed() introduced in Vue 3’s Composition API for managing state and reactivity.
> 

> Single File Components (SFCs): Files with .vue extension encapsulating template, script, and style in one file.
> 

> Plugins: Extend Vue's functionality with reusable plugins for tasks like validation or analytics.
