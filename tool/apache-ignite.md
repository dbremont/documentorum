## Internals

Here is a table summarizing the key internal components and concepts of Apache Ignite:

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cluster** | A group of nodes working together to store and process data, with each node managing a subset of data and coordinating with others for data sharing and replication. |
| **Data Grid** | The in-memory data storage layer responsible for managing and storing data across the cluster, offering distributed caching, transactions, and SQL queries. |
| **Compute Grid** | The distributed computation layer that enables parallel execution of computations across the cluster, with features such as load balancing, fault tolerance, and job scheduling. |
| **Communication** | A peer-to-peer communication model where nodes interact directly using a custom TCP/IP-based protocol, supporting message fragmentation, batching, and priority-based messaging. |
| **Topology** | The current state of the cluster, including node count, data distribution, and computation task assignments. |
| **Memory Management** | Distributed memory management using on-heap and off-heap memory and memory-mapped files with features for memory eviction, overflow, and compression. |
| **Persistence** | Optional support for persistent storage, allowing data to be stored on disk in addition to memory, using a pluggable storage API and supporting various storage technologies. |
| **Security** | Security features including encryption, authentication, and authorization, implemented via a pluggable security API and supporting technologies like SSL, LDAP, and Kerberos. |
| **Transactions** | Support for distributed transactions with atomic data updates across multiple nodes, using a two-phase commit protocol and features like isolation levels, timeout handling, and recovery. |
| **Monitoring and Management** | Features for monitoring and managing the system, including a web-based management console, a JMX-based API, and integration with third-party monitoring tools such as Grafana and Prometheus. |

## Case Study

### Real-time Risk Analytics

> Used Ignite as an in-memory compute grid for running Monte Carlo simulations on portfolios, reducing calculation times from hours to minutes.

### Fraud Detection

> Leveraged Ignite’s distributed cache + compute grid to process millions of transactions per second with low latency.

## Terminology

- **SPI**:  Service Provider Interface.
