## Formulation

| **Aspect**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implementation**        | Written in **Rust**, providing low-level control over filesystem operations, parallel I/O, and dependency graph resolution.                                                                                                                        |
| **Core Model**            | Implements a **content-addressable package cache** and **link-based virtual environments**, where package wheels are stored globally and referenced via **hardlinks or symlinks** to achieve deduplication.                                        |
| **Dependency Resolution** | Performs **parallel, constraint-based dependency resolution** over the **Python packaging metadata graph** (`METADATA`, `Requires-Dist`), yielding a **deterministic lockfile** (`uv.lock`) that encodes exact version, ABI, and platform triples. |
| **Execution Environment** | Uses an **environment virtualization layer** compatible with Python’s `venv` model, but built atop its own filesystem layout and activation mechanism, avoiding Python startup overhead.                                                           |
| **Caching System**        | Maintains a **global immutable cache** keyed by cryptographic hashes of wheel metadata, Python ABI tags, and source distributions; enabling **zero-copy environment instantiation** and **instant reuse** across projects.                         |
| **Build Integration**     | Complies with **PEP 517/518 build backends** and **PEP 621 metadata**; integrates directly with `pyproject.toml` for declarative dependency and environment definitions.                                                                           |
| **CLI Design**            | Provides subcommands such as `uv pip`, `uv venv`, `uv run`, and `uv sync`, exposing a unified interface for installation, environment creation, script execution, and lockfile synchronization.                                                    |
| **Execution Semantics**   | Executes Python commands within temporary or persistent virtual environments, automatically resolving and installing dependencies when necessary, and ensuring reproducible runtime state.                                                         |
| **Determinism**           | Guarantees reproducibility through **lockfile-based dependency graphs**, normalized wheel resolution, and platform tagging following the **PEP 425 compatibility tag specification**.                                                              |
| **Concurrency Model**     | Uses **asynchronous, parallelized I/O** for network fetches, wheel installation, and metadata parsing, drastically outperforming Python-based package managers.                                                                                    |
| **System Integration**    | Provides transparent compatibility with `pip` and `venv` commands, allowing it to serve as a **drop-in replacement** while preserving standard Python packaging semantics.                                                                         |

## QA

* Does `uv` copy dependencies into the project directory or reference them from a shared cache?
* How does `uv` resolve transitive dependencies compared to `pip`’s resolver?
* Is the dependency graph resolution deterministic across platforms and Python versions?
* How does `uv` manage environment isolation — does it use `venv`, its own layout, or a hybrid model?
* What is the structure and location of the global cache, and how are wheels indexed (by hash, ABI, platform)?
* How does `uv` detect and reuse cached wheels when rebuilding environments?
* Can `uv` operate fully offline once packages are cached locally?
* Does `uv` support editable installs (`-e .`) for local development, and how are they represented in the lockfile?
* How does `uv` handle version conflicts or incompatible dependency specifications?
* What is the format and purpose of the `uv.lock` file, and how is it different from `requirements.txt`?
* How are Python interpreters detected, selected, or isolated across multiple environments?
* How does `uv` integrate with `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621/PEP 517/518)?
* Is environment activation required for `uv run`, or does it handle execution context implicitly?
* How does `uv` ensure reproducibility across machines — does it record platform tags, Python ABI, or hash metadata?
* Can `uv` environments be shared or reconstructed deterministically from a lockfile on another system?
* How does `uv` compare performance-wise to `pip + virtualenv` or `poetry install` in cold vs. warm runs?
* What mechanisms prevent cache corruption or version skew in shared environments?
* How does `uv` manage binary dependencies and compiled wheels (e.g., for C extensions)?
* Does `uv` respect system package indexes (custom PyPI, internal mirrors, etc.)?
* How does `uv` handle dependency resolution for optional extras (`requests[security]`)?
* Can `uv` be embedded or invoked programmatically as a library?
* Does `uv` track environment provenance or build metadata (similar to `pip freeze`)?
* How does `uv` differ from `hatch`, `poetry`, and `conda` in environment modeling?
* What are the atomicity guarantees during environment synchronization (`uv sync`)?
* How does `uv` manage concurrency and locking when multiple installs occur simultaneously?
* Does `uv` provide isolation between different Python versions installed via `pyenv` or system interpreters?
* Can `uv` build wheels locally (PEP 517 backends) or does it rely entirely on prebuilt distributions?
* How does `uv` handle upgrade/downgrade cycles — are environments transactional?
* Is there a formal specification for the `uv.lock` format, and is it forward-compatible?
* How does `uv` interact with native package managers (APT, Homebrew) for system dependencies?
