## Formulation

Model Neovim as:

$S_{t+1} = T_o(S_t, \tau_t, E_t)$

Where:

* **State ($S_t$)** = buffers + windows + tabpages + registers + marks + options + Lua runtime state.
* **Trigger ($τ_t$)** = keystrokes, RPC calls, Lua API invocations, autocommands.
* **Environment ($E_t$)** = filesystem, OS, terminal UI, LSP servers, external plugins.

## **Structure**

> What is the **internal structure** of this technical object?

Neovim consists of:

1. **Core Editor Engine** (C)
2. **Event Loop (libuv-based async runtime)**
3. **Lua Runtime (embedded interpreter)**
4. **RPC Layer (msgpack-RPC)**
5. **UI Abstraction Layer**
6. **Buffer/Window/Tabpage Model**
7. **Extensibility Interface (`vim.api`)**
8. Macro Sub System: ...

### Dynamics

- **(Induced Dynamics)** What types of dynamics are induced by the technical object? Which are the types of dynamics that can be trigger? What kinds of state-transformation processes can be triggered? **Which dynamics can be induced using `vim.api`?**
- **(Conception of State)** What is the most useful formal conception of “state” for analyzing this technical object?  Which components of the state are external (i.e., environmental)?
- **(Triggering)** How are the dynamics **trigger**?  Which triggers are user-initiated, system-initiated, or externally induced?  Are triggers synchronous, asynchronous, event-driven, or continuous?
- (**Interaction - Complementary**)  Which **‘external elements’ does the technical object require** to ‘induce dynamics’?   Which **elements are** **needed to trigger** such dynamics?

#### **(Induced Dynamics)** What types of dynamics are induced by the technical object? Which are the types of dynamics that can be trigger? What kinds of state-transformation processes can be triggered? **Which dynamics can be induced using `vim.api`?**

Neovim induces:

* Text transformations (insert/delete/replace)
* Structural transformations (window splits, buffer switches)
* Register mutations
* Highlighting and virtual text rendering
* Async job spawning
* LSP request/response cycles

**Using `vim.api` you can induce:**

* Buffer mutations (`nvim_buf_set_lines`)
* Extmarks and virtual text
* Window layout manipulation
* Autocommand creation
* Keymap injection
* RPC communication

Thus, `vim.api` exposes the internal transition operator (T_o).

#### **(Conception of State)** What is the most useful formal conception of “state” for analyzing this technical object?  Which components of the state are external (i.e., environmental)?

A useful decomposition:

**Internal State**:

* Buffer contents
* Cursor positions
* Registers
* Marks
* Keymaps
* Lua runtime memory
* Extmarks

**External (Environmental) State**:

* Filesystem
* Terminal emulator
* OS processes
* LSP servers
* Tree-sitter parsers

#### **(Triggering)** How are the dynamics **trigger**?  Which triggers are user-initiated, system-initiated, or externally induced?  Are triggers synchronous, asynchronous, event-driven, or continuous?

Triggers include:

| Type                   | Examples                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **User-Initiated**     | Keystrokes, command-line commands     |
| **System-Initiated**   | Autocommands (BufEnter, TextChanged)  |
| **Externally Induced** | RPC calls from plugins, LSP responses |
| **Synchronous**        | `:normal` commands                    |
| **Asynchronous**       | `vim.loop`, jobstart, LSP callbacks   |
| **Event-Driven**       | CursorMoved, InsertEnter              |

#### (**Interaction - Complementary**)  Which **‘external elements’ does the technical object require** to ‘induce dynamics’?   Which **elements are** **needed to trigger** such dynamics?

External elements required:

* Terminal emulator (UI client)
* LSP servers
* Git
* Compiler toolchains
* Tree-sitter grammars
* Plugin manager (e.g., lazy.nvim)

Without these, induced dynamics are limited to raw text editing.

## Usage

> How to use this technical object?

```bash
-- print data path
:lua print(vim.fn.stdpath("data"))
```

[x] You can trigger the completion manually by pressing `<C-x><C-o>` (in Insert mode) or simply use Neovim's built-in completion features.

## ❓ QA

* What is the latency profile of buffer operations?
* How does the extmark system model persistent annotations?
* How does the RPC boundary isolate plugins?
* What invariants does the buffer model maintain?
* How does the UI protocol abstract rendering from core logic?
* Where are race conditions possible in async workflows?
