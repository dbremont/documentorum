## Formulation

| **Aspect**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implementation**        | Written in **Rust**, providing low-level control over filesystem operations, parallel I/O, and dependency graph resolution.                                                                                                                        |
| **Core Model**            | Implements a **content-addressable package cache** and **link-based virtual environments**, where package wheels are stored globally and referenced via **hardlinks or symlinks** to achieve deduplication.                                        |
| **Dependency Resolution** | Performs **parallel, constraint-based dependency resolution** over the **Python packaging metadata graph** (`METADATA`, `Requires-Dist`), yielding a **deterministic lockfile** (`uv.lock`) that encodes exact version, ABI, and platform triples. |
| **Execution Environment** | Uses an **environment virtualization layer** compatible with Pythonâ€™s `venv` model, but built atop its own filesystem layout and activation mechanism, avoiding Python startup overhead.                                                           |
| **Caching System**        | Maintains a **global immutable cache** keyed by cryptographic hashes of wheel metadata, Python ABI tags, and source distributions; enabling **zero-copy environment instantiation** and **instant reuse** across projects.                         |
| **Build Integration**     | Complies with **PEP 517/518 build backends** and **PEP 621 metadata**; integrates directly with `pyproject.toml` for declarative dependency and environment definitions.                                                                           |
| **CLI Design**            | Provides subcommands such as `uv pip`, `uv venv`, `uv run`, and `uv sync`, exposing a unified interface for installation, environment creation, script execution, and lockfile synchronization.                                                    |
| **Execution Semantics**   | Executes Python commands within temporary or persistent virtual environments, automatically resolving and installing dependencies when necessary, and ensuring reproducible runtime state.                                                         |
| **Determinism**           | Guarantees reproducibility through **lockfile-based dependency graphs**, normalized wheel resolution, and platform tagging following the **PEP 425 compatibility tag specification**.                                                              |
| **Concurrency Model**     | Uses **asynchronous, parallelized I/O** for network fetches, wheel installation, and metadata parsing, drastically outperforming Python-based package managers.                                                                                    |
| **System Integration**    | Provides transparent compatibility with `pip` and `venv` commands, allowing it to serve as a **drop-in replacement** while preserving standard Python packaging semantics.                                                                         |

* How does `uv` resolve transitive dependencies compared to `pip`â€™s resolver?
* Is the dependency graph resolution deterministic across platforms and Python versions?

* How does `uv` detect and reuse cached wheels when rebuilding environments?
* Can `uv` operate fully offline once packages are cached locally?
* Does `uv` support editable installs (`-e .`) for local development, and how are they represented in the lockfile?

* What is the format and purpose of the `uv.lock` file, and how is it different from `requirements.txt`?
* How are Python interpreters detected, selected, or isolated across multiple environments?
* How does `uv` integrate with `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621/PEP 517/518)?
* Is environment activation required for `uv run`, or does it handle execution context implicitly?
